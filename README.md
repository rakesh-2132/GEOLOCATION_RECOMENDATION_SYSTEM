# GEOLOCATION_RECOMENDATION_SYSTEM

OVERVIEW/OBJECTIVE:

   This undertaking entails employing the K-Means Clustering technique to identify optimal lodging options for students in Bangalore (or an alternate city of your preference). 
   This will be achieved by categorizing potential accommodations for incoming students, considering their expressed preferences for amenities, budgetary constraints, and proximity to desired locations.

PROJECT STAGES:

   ![STAGE](https://github.com/rakesh-2132/GEOLOCATION_RECOMENDATION_SYSTEM/assets/109949929/dfde04ec-e614-49c3-8319-dee33df12f42)


STEPS INVLOLVED :
      • Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection)
      
      • Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas)
      
      • Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)
      
      • Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)
      
      • Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)
      
      • Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)

MAJOR LIBRARIES USED:

      1.NUMPY,PANDAS //FOR DATA
      
      2.MATPLOTLIB,SEABOARN // FOR PLOTTING
      
      3.FOLIUM,GEOPY // FOR GEOSPAITAL
      
      4.SKLEARN,SCIPY //FOR MACHINE LEARNING
      
      5.MINSOM  // FOR DEEP LEARNING

APIS USED:
   1.FORSQUARE API:

      we need to get geolocational data from the Foursquare API to find these people some accomodation!
      
      Requirements
      
       • Make a free foursquare account and get your API credentials set up. 
       
       • Set up your query in such a way that you can check for residential locations in a fixed radius around a point of your choosing.

FINAL OUTCOME:
